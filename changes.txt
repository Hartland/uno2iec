================================================================================

June 9, 2007: Version 0.8 : By Larsp. This version is on mmc2iec batch 1 units

- Huge change to interface.c and d64driver.c and t64driver.c. A function pointer
  interface is now utilized for the different file formats, cleaning up the code
  and allowing elegant implementation of multiple file formats.
  
- Save-With-Replace implemented.
  
- M2I file format introduced allowing 16 char petscii filenames with read/write
  access. The file is a simple index with the petscii filenames and
  corresponding FAT files. 
  
- Command channel commands implemented. Scratch and Rename works in FAT mode and
  in M2I mode they also work with wildcards. New disk also works and initializes
  a new M2I file with the given name.

- Error channel messages implemented. 

- Device 10/8 selection jumper implemented. In conjunction with device 9/8
  jumper, device 8, 9, 10, 11 is now selectable.

- IEC_driver.c now actually uses config.h settings.

================================================================================

May 13, 2007: Version 0.7 : By Larsp

- config.h introduced. Hardware configuration and other flags are defined in 
  this file. It is also possible to disable v0.7 hardware features, to make 
  hardware requirements equivalent to v0.6.

- IEC protocol has been fixed to allow multiple IEC devices on the bus.

- Mechanical card detect switch is taken advantage of now. When no card is 
  present, ?FILE NOT FOUND occurs. When a card is present, it is repeatedly
  initialized (BUSY LED flashes) until successful. This feature practically
  eliminates the need to use load"<<",8 to initialize the card.
  
- Mechanical write protect switch implemented. The sdcard module will fail to 
  write sectors if write protect.
  
- Minor space savings and improvements in FAT driver. If FAT driver fails to 
  write changes back (e.g. write protect), DIRTY LED will simply keep being lit.

- Device 9/8 selection jumper implemented.

================================================================================

April 24, 2007: Version 0.6.1 : By Spaceman Spiff

- Zapped the hex2char function from util.c. This function is not used, and was
  not correct.

- Fixed a lot of string types to signed char instead of unsigned char, since this
  is the default for the C library functions. This gets rid of the "passing arg xx
  to function yyyyy differ in signedness" which otherwise happens with newer 
  compilers.


================================================================================

April 5, 2007: Version 0.6 

- IEC_driver.c
The IEC protocol timing values are now set using #defines and the timing has
been corrected to achieve better stability.

Communication works with C64 as well as DTV now.


- t64driver.c
Support for T64 files that has the "num used" value wrong which is apparently 
very common.


- interface.c
Bug fix: Before, the interface was not properly initialized at cold reset, and 
this was not apparent to the user. Now that situation IS apparent, and the 
interface IS properly initialized.

Improved error handling and messaging.

Support for P00 files.


- sdcard.c
Detection of failed SD/MMC communication

================================================================================
February 5, 2007: Version 0.5 

- First release
